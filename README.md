## Apptainer environment

In order to improve reproducability, we ran all of our code using a single [Apptainer (previously known as Singularity)](https://apptainer.org) container. This container can be built using the included recipe file [apptainer_recipe.def](./apptainer_recipe.def) as described in the apptainer documentation. Make sure you include the image path you select, e.g. `path/to/image/location.sif`, in your version of the configuration file [config.ini](./config_sample.ini). 

To execute a .py script, simply run

```bash
$ apptainer run path/to/image/location.sif -nv path/to/script/file.py --script_args
```

in order to run one of the jupyter notebooks, you can start a jupyter lab session by running

```bash
$ apptainer exec path/to/image/location.sif -nv jupyter
```

## Running trained single- and multi-frame models

Steps:

1. Set up your local paths and other environment variables in the [config.ini](./config.ini) file.

2. Download the satellite data, calculate the dataset variables and prepare the cross-validation folds as outlined in the [preprocessing](./preprocessing) directory.

3. Make predictions for the different pretrained models by running [inference_model.py](./inference/inference_model.py). In case your system is equipped with [Slurm](https://slurm.schedmd.com/documentation.html), you can simply run the [inference_model.sh](./inference/inference_model.sh) script 

4. Generate the figures as presented in the paper by running the [evaluate_results/model_evaluation.ipynb](evaluate_results/model_evaluation.ipynb) and [evaluate_results/ts_effect.ipynb](evaluate_results/ts_effect.ipynb) notebooks.

## Acknowledgements
Preprocessing and evaluation code in this repository takes a lot of inspiration from the [work by Yeh et al.](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-16185-w), creators of the architecture we call "single-frame model".
